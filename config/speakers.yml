    title: 'High Efficiency Power Circuits for Embedded Devices'
    affiliation: National Instruments
    bio: >
      Very high efficiency power converters have been essential equipment in the
      server and telecom markets for decades.  More recently, electric vehicle
      chargers have been getting a lot of attention from academic research.  Why
      hasn't the embedded market kept pace?

       This presentation will focus on unique challenges in designing efficient
       power converters for embedded products.  We'll look at the embedded power
       market from a high level and compare it to others.  Additionally, we'll
       look at some low-level, technical ideas to lower the power losses in
       embedded designs.

        Tim graduated from Case in 2008 with a BS in Electrical Engineering.
        Afterward, he move to Austin, TX to work at National Instruments on the
        Controller Architectures team. Now, he's a Senior Hardware Engineer with
        more than 7 years of experience as a circuit designer specializing in
        industrial embedded controllers.

    title: 'Attacking the Monolith'
    twitter: '@bstack01'
    bio: >
      Software that is designed in a hurry (also known as all software) tends to
      coalesce into a gigantic ball of mud. Design decisions that once seemed
      prudent are hammered into all sorts of odd shapes to allow for extra
      features to be added or bugs to be fixed. This is not strictly a bad
      thing; most of the software in the world is supposed to create value, not
      just sit there and be pretty. However, going too far in one direction can
      drag development to a halt.

       I've spent the last two years of my working life building tools and
       defining processes that allow developers to tread the fine line between
       too-ugly and just-ugly-enough. Some of my ideas have worked and some have
       not. I'd like to share the lessons I've learned with you.

       Brian is a 2013 graduate of CWRU who just moved back to the region after
       living and working for two years in San Francisco. He worked primarily on
       building tools for developers such as distributed test running systems
       that cut test runtimes from tens of hours to minutes.

  - name: Ben Horstman
    affiliation: MIM Software Inc.
    title: 'Java 8 Stream API: Examples from Industry'
    bio: >
      Java 8 was released last year with the headline feature of Project Lambda.
       Including a stream processing API, function literal syntax, and
      improvements to type inference, Project Lambda enables functional
      paradigms inside a popular OO language.

       This talk will provide a brief introduction to Project Lambda and explain
       the motivations behind its development.  Then, I'll demonstrate the API
       with examples lifted from our production code base - the good, and the
       bad.  Finally, I'll end with a discussion about potential improvements.

       Benjamin received his masters degree in CS from CWRU in 2010, studying
       computational genetics.  Since then he's been a Software Team Lead for
       Beachwood based MIM Software Inc., working on products such as Symphony
       Brachytherapy and Encore Nuclear Medicine, as well as leading technical
       initiatives on version control, automated testing, retina (Hi-DPI)
       rendering, and concurrent/functional programming.

      startups, creating new industries, and how visionaries and entrepreneurs
      help commercialize breakthrough technologies by working closely with
      university research labs and their technology transfer offices. We will
      focus the whole process, with examples, starting with the key initial step
      of identifying target markets and potential opportunities, then working
      backwards to quantify and position the innovative technology against
      ongoing solutions, product roadmaps, and market demands.

      You’ve studied hard. You know how to code. What’s next? Technology is a
      wide and deep industry with a variety of career paths to choose from. What
      is it like in the real world? What can you expect working in IT? On a
      project, more often than not, the questions clients and managers ask
      technical folks isn’t “how”, but “when”. Project challenges are often not
      a question of innovation but rather, with process and collaboration. The
      Agile methodology helps answer the questions; "When will it be done?",
      “What should we work on next?" and "How hard is it?” Learn strategies for
      breaking down large requirements into sizable units of work, how to track
      progress, manage changes in scope, and work on the most valuable thing.
      Come learn the basics of Agile development process, a technical
      professional’s best friend to delivering valuable, working software.

    affiliation: CSE Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
    title: 'Sending Mail Through the Sewer: Long-Haul Data Transmission on Shortwave Frequencies'
    bio: >
      Today's data wireless data transmission emphasis is largely on
      wide-bandwidth, high-speed links on UHF/SHF bands. HF (shortwave) is
      different: The conflicting constraints of long distances, noisy channels,
      narrow-bandwidth and low power budgets require quite different techniques
      for succesful communications on HF. We will discuss history and
      contemporary use and state of development on amateur radio bands.
      Discussion will include minimum-bandwidth phase-shift systems; error
      correction systems; automatic link establishment; amateur radio email; and
      methods for low speed signalling in extremely poor signal-to-noise ratio
      environments.

       David Kazdan has been interested in shortwave communications issues since
       preparing for his Novice class amateur radio license examination in 1970.
       He studied electrical engineering at MIT, biomedical engineering here at
       Case, and other stuff elsewhere--we'll leave it at that.

    title: "Progress in Radiation Oncology: A Software Story"
    bio: >
        Treating cancer using radiation is a technology that is over a century
        old, and the first treatment that used a linear particle accelerator
        dates back to 1953.  However, there has been an explosion in the types
        and complexity of radiation treatment over the past two decades, and
        it's not largely a story of improved accelerator hardware.  Rather, much
        like the Apollo landings were enabled by then-recent advances in
        computer technology, radiation oncology has been revolutionized by new
        algorithms whose routine use is made possible by the exponential growth
        in computational power.  This is a story that brings together the
        influences that computing hardware, robotics, algorithms research,
        high-performance computing, and user-interface design have had on the
        process of shooting radiation at patients - and the challenges that this
        added complexity has brought for doctors and developers.

        Paul Jacobs is the Engineering Team Lead for the Research Engineering
        Team at MIM Software, Inc, a Cleveland-area company that develops
        products for the radiation oncology, radiology, and nuclear medicine

    bio: >
      Object-oriented design principles haven't had the effect we hoped for. The
      SOLID principles are excellent design guidelines, but experience shows
      that programmers find them difficult to follow. What do we do about this?
      Surprisingly, the Structured Design literature of forty years ago contains
      compelling solutions to many current design problems. They're simple and
      easy to understand, but were lost in the noise as OO rose to popularity.
      We'll reinterpret these simple design ideas in a modern context, finding
      that many of our most promising new design ideas resemble them. Rapid web
      application development, the area of professional programming in most dire
      need of design improvements, will serve as an example.

    title: Stateless / Immutable Webapps - Stealing Ideas from Functional Patterns
    bio: >
      How can we utilize functional principles(SOC, data-in-data-out functions,
      etc...), while still keeping standard but very non-functional tools while
      working within the python ecosystem. How can these drastically different
      paradigms fit together?

      Some great things happened through a years worth of experimentation. Tests
      are fast, small, and easy(less use of mocks and other advanced testing
      tools) out of the box. What data a view or function actually needs is
      readably apparent, mocking database calls become completely unnecessary
      (due to the makeup of the new data models), other kind of data sources
      were trivial to convert; data just looked like data no matter where it
      came from(the file system, an ORM, redis, mongo).

      What might we discover by looking at a codebase from a different
      perspective? I would like to share some of this journey, talk about
      separating data from functionality(the good times, the bad times), some of
      the code that emerged, and things we can take away from this grand
      experiment.

    title: Measuring Instead of Speculating
    bio: >
      C is clearly the dominant language for programming embedded systems, in
      large part because it provides convenient and efficient access to hardware
      devices.  C++ offers additional object-oriented facilities that provide
      higher levels of abstraction, yet it remains a distant second choice for
      embedded programming.  Many practicing C programmers assert without proof
      that using C++ objects for hardware accesses is too costly to use.  This
      session explains how to actually measure such claims.  It also presents
      actual measurements showing that some widely-used C techniques can
      actually be much slower than straightforward C++ techniques.

      Dan Saks is the president of Saks & Associates, which offers training and
      consulting in C and C++ and their use in developing embedded systems. Dan
      writes the Programming Pointers column for Embedded.com online.  He has
      written columns for several other publications including The C/C++ Users
      Journal, The C++ Report, Embedded Systems Design, and Software
      Development.  With Thomas Plum, he wrote C++ Programming Guidelines, which
      won a Computer Language Magazine Productivity Award as one of the best
      books of 1992.  Dan served as secretary of the ANSI and ISO C++ Standards
      committees and as a member of the ANSI C Standards committee.  More
      recently, he contributed to the CERT Secure C Coding Standard and the CERT
      Secure C++ Coding Standard.  He is also a Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable
      Professional).  Dan has a BS in Mathematics from CWRU and an MSE in
      Computer Science from the University of Pennsylvania.

    title: A Day In The Life Of An Open Source Analog Electrical Engineer
    bio: >
      In the past, getting your electronics project started and out the door
      quickly meant you either had a huge team at your disposal or you were
      paying a lot for design tools that would allow you to complete a task
      quickly and effectively. More recently, teams, project schedules and
      budgets seem to shrink on a daily basis, with more expected from the final
      output. What is a designer to do? Much like the tools that have
      revolutionized how software designers create their projects, these tools
      have begun trickling into the lives of hardware designers, both in how
      they create and share their projects. Chris Gammell will share how he has
      utilized many of these open source tools and projects to create an
      educational course around analog sensors and how the output of the course
      will be open source hardware.

      Chris Gammell is a full time analog electrical engineer and part time
      talker/blogger/podcaster/vidcaster. A 2006 graduate from CWRU, Chris has
      worked in fields such as RF, DSP, silicon manufacturing, precise test and
      measurement manufacturing and most recently, large scale industrial
      process control. Outside of work, Chris has a podcast called The Amp Hour
      with Dave Jones of the EEVblog. This weekly transpacific show (Dave lives
      in Sydney Australia) covers industry news, open source projects,
      interviews with a wide range of guests and fun banter about electronics.
      Most recently, Chris has started a new endeavor called Contextual
      Electronics, which is a 10 week course teaching people how to design and
      build electronics with a practical, hands on approach. All products
      developed through CE are licensed as Open Source Hardware to be shared and
      modified (or sold!) by anyone in the world.

    title: Lessons Learned from a Career in Technology
    bio: >
      Good engineers always perform a lessons learned activity after completing
      a project in order to improve performance on future projects.  Yet,
      engineers don’t always apply this technique to their lives and careers as
      they reach various milestones.  How much did good grades matter?  What
      kept me up past midnight?  What did moped congestion in Thailand teach me
      about building smarter cars? Together, we will explore how our education,
      passions, and experiences can be leveraged to make us more effective
      problem solvers.

      Isaac White graduated with a BS in Computer Engineering from Case Western
      Reserve in 2005 where he was a four year member of the men’s basketball
      team. He began his career working for Lockheed Martin as a software
      engineer in the Washington, DC area.  During that time he served in a
      number of roles including software developer, security and database
      administrator, and technical proposal manager while working on contracts
      for the IRS and TSA. In 2010 he earned a MS in information Systems from
      Johns Hopkins University. In May of 2013 he joined Microsoft’s
      Productivity, Access, and Identity Experience (PAIX) group in Redmond, WA
      where he serves as a software design engineer.

      Prior to leaving the Washington, DC area Isaac served as the head coach of
      the DC Vipers youth men’s basketball program.  He also founded Out of
      Bounds, a non-profit organization, which focuses on educating high school
      student athletes about college athletic scholarship eligibility.  Isaac is
      an avid basketball player, a photo hobbyist, and is enthusiastic about web
      design and mobile technology.   His passions include talking to young
      people about life and their careers, and using technology to solve the
      world’s problems.

    title: MapReduce and Google's Pregel Framework
    bio: >
      The talk starts with a brief introduction of the MapReduce system. The
      MapReduce system makes it easy to parallelize a particular form of
      computation across a large data set. It automates the process of
      splitting up and coordinating that computation and its data to run on
      thousands of machines at once. Although the implementation of
      MapReduce is complex, understanding MapReduce is actually not hard.

      Next, the Pregel project will be introduced. The objective of the
      Pregel project is to provide a unified framework for performing
      large-scale graph computations at Google that enables users to focus
      on the actual algorithm, leaving many details to the Pregel framework,
      such as distributed and multi-threaded execution, load-balancing,
      fault tolerance, data representation. This introduction explains the
      basics of defining, running, and testing a graph algorithm using
      Pregel, as well as how the system is designed.

      Shijie Zhang received her BE in Computer Science from Shanghai Jiao
      Tong University, and Ph.D. from Case Western Reserve University. Her
      research ranged from Data Mining, Graph Indexing Algorithms,
      Bioinformatics, Computer Vision, and Recommendation Systems. She has
      published a number of research papers and filed a few patents. Now
      she works at Google as a software engineer.
