  - name: Lynn Nickels and Paula Hidalgo
    affiliation: Rockwell Automation
    title: Paying it Forward and So, You're Interested in a Career in Computer Science
    bio: >
      Paula will talk about what it means to work in industry within the Computer Science 
      arena. You can hear what it's like to work as a programmer/analyst, an information 
      technology lead, and a project manager. Paula is currently a Project Manager at 
      Rockwell Automation and has a passion for improving organizational effectiveness and
      mentoring others. Her strengths are in taking complexity and constraints and 
      translating them into effective and actionable steps to deliver project results. She 
      holds a BS Chemical Engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and an MS 
      Chemical Engineering from CWRU.
      

      Lynn's love for all things technical and her goal of never putting all of her career
      eggs in one basket has led her down a winding road with stops along the way that include
      CAD design, technical writing, teaching computer programing, and now, marketing 
      industrial automation products. What else is a non-engineer type to do but race toward
      promoting STEM education and technical careers? Let's face it, working for free never
      ends and can pay you back in a way that you never thought possible! A full-time Global
      Marketing Communicator at Rockwell Automation, Lynn also moonlights as an Academic
      Relations Representative for local colleges and an online newsletter editor for the 
      Northeast Ohio Society for TEchnical Communicators. She is also a member of the Cleveland
      Professional Women's Group team at Rockwell, but her favorite stop has to be her STEM
      initiatives participation with events like Girls Go Science, Engineers Week and Manufacturing Day,
      and the value received from helpin young people develop a love like hers - for all things
      technical!

    title: Turning The Design Clock Back
    twitter: '@garybernhardt'
    bio: >
      Object-oriented design principles haven't had the effect we hoped for. The
      SOLID principles are excellent design guidelines, but experience shows that
      programmers find them difficult to follow. What do we do about this?
      Surprisingly, the Structured Design literature of forty years ago contains
      compelling solutions to many current design problems. They're simple and
      easy to understand, but were lost in the noise as OO rose to popularity.
      We'll reinterpret these simple design ideas in a modern context, finding
      that many of our most promising new design ideas resemble them. Rapid web
      application development, the area of professional programming in most dire
      need of design improvements, will serve as an example.


      Gary is a top-notch Ruby and Python test-driven developer, but has plenty of solid
      advice to offer everyone. Not only that, but we think you're going to love his sense
      of humor. Check out his website, Destroy All Software, to read his blog, check out

    title: Is it Working? Lessons Learned about Monitoring Large Web Applications
    email: 'bstack@yelp.com'
    bio: >
      You've built the site, now how do you know it's working?  Modern websites
      are made up of a myriad of moving parts that all must work in harmony.  How
      can you know that your website is working and how can you figure out what's
      wrong as quickly as possible when your website inevitably breaks?  A robust
      and performant monitoring infrastructure makes a world of difference for your
      infrastructure and developers alike.  Come learn about how Yelp monitors
      its infrastructure and makes sure the website works!


      Brian Stack graduated from CWRU in 2013 with a BS in Computer Science.
      He started an internship at Yelp the summer after his junior year and hasn't
      looked back since.  He came back to the infrastructure team after finishing
      his senior year and has been working to keep the site fast and keeping
      developers productive ever since.  While in school he worked on figuring out
      how networks actually work with Mark Allman (neither of them have quite
      figured it out yet).

      40% of users will abandon websites that take over three seconds to load.
      Even if your web application is straddling this boundary, by adopting a mobile-first
      design paradigm your web application will be more responsive on all browsers
      and devices. This talk will cover some common progressive enhancement techniques
      and how to make sure you're not leaving any users behind.


      Tom Dooner is a Software Engineer at Causes, the world's largest online campaigning
      platform. Born and raised a web developer, he recently moved from Cleveland to

  - name: Matt O'Donnell
    affiliation: Leandog
    title: Stateless / Immutable Webapps - Stealing Ideas from Functional Patterns
    bio: >
      How can we utilize functional principles(SOC, data-in-data-out functions, etc...),
      while still keeping standard but very non-functional tools while working within the
      python ecosystem. How can these drastically different paradigms fit together?


      Some great things happened through a years worth of experimentation. Tests are fast,
      small, and easy(less use of mocks and other advanced testing tools) out of the box.
      What data a view or function actually needs is readably apparent, mocking database calls
      become completely unnecessary (due to the makeup of the new data models), other kind of
      data sources were trivial to convert; data just looked like data no matter where it
      came from(the file system, an ORM, redis, mongo).


      What might we discover by looking at a codebase from a different perspective? I would
      like to share some of this journey, talk about separating data from functionality(the
      good times, the bad times), some of the code that emerged, and things we can take
      away from this grand experiment.  


      Matt is a web developer at LeanDog in Cleveland, Ohio. By day, he makes engaging
      and useful things for the web. By night, he hacks on python in search of a
      better understanding around the definition and practice of "craftsmanship".

  - name: Dan Saks
    affiliation: Saks & Associates
    title: Measuring Instead of Speculating
    bio: >
      C is clearly the dominant language for programming embedded
      systems, in large part because it provides convenient and efficient access
      to hardware devices.  C++ offers additional object-oriented facilities
      that provide higher levels of abstraction, yet it remains a distant second
      choice for embedded programming.  Many practicing C programmers assert
      without proof that using C++ objects for hardware accesses is too costly
      to use.  This session explains how to actually measure such claims.  It
      also presents actual measurements showing that some widely-used C
      techniques can actually be much slower than straightforward C++ techniques.


      Dan Saks is the president of Saks & Associates, which offers training
      and consulting in C and C++ and their use in developing embedded systems.
      Dan writes the Programming Pointers column for Embedded.com online.  He
      has written columns for several other publications including The C/C++
      Users Journal, The C++ Report, Embedded Systems Design, and Software
      Development.  With Thomas Plum, he wrote C++ Programming Guidelines, which
      won a Computer Language Magazine Productivity Award as one of the best
      books of 1992.  Dan served as secretary of the ANSI and ISO C++ Standards
      committees and as a member of the ANSI C Standards committee.  More
      recently, he contributed to the CERT Secure C Coding Standard and the CERT
      Secure C++ Coding Standard.  He is also a Microsoft MVP (Most Valuable

    affiliation: The Amp Hour
    title: A Day In The Life Of An Open Source Analog Electrical Engineer
    bio: >
      In the past, getting your electronics project started and out the door
      quickly meant you either had a huge team at your disposal or you were
      paying a lot for design tools that would allow you to complete a task
      quickly and effectively. More recently, teams, project schedules and
      budgets seem to shrink on a daily basis, with more expected from the final
      output. What is a designer to do? Much like the tools that have revolutionized
      how software designers create their projects, these tools have begun trickling
      into the lives of hardware designers, both in how they create and share their
      projects. Chris Gammell will share how he has utilized many of these open
      source tools and projects to create an educational course around analog
      sensors and how the output of the course will be open source hardware. 

      Chris Gammell is a full time analog electrical engineer and part time
      talker/blogger/podcaster/vidcaster. A 2006 graduate from CWRU, Chris has
      worked in fields such as RF, DSP, silicon manufacturing, precise test and
      measurement manufacturing and most recently, large scale industrial process
      control. Outside of work, Chris has a podcast called The Amp Hour with Dave
      Jones of the EEVblog. This weekly transpacific show (Dave lives in Sydney
      Australia) covers industry news, open source projects, interviews with a
      wide range of guests and fun banter about electronics. Most recently, Chris
      has started a new endeavor called Contextual Electronics, which is a 10
      week course teaching people how to design and build electronics with a
      practical, hands on approach. All products developed through CE are licensed
      as Open Source Hardware to be shared and modified (or sold!) by anyone in the world.

    title: Lessons Learned from a Career in Technology
    bio: >
      Good engineers always perform a lessons learned activity after completing
      a project in order to improve performance on future projects.  Yet, engineers
      don’t always apply this technique to their lives and careers as they reach
      various milestones.  How much did good grades matter?  What kept me up past
      midnight?  What did moped congestion in Thailand teach me about building
      smarter cars? Together, we will explore how our education, passions, and
      experiences can be leveraged to make us more effective problem solvers.


      Isaac White graduated with a BS in Computer Engineering from Case Western
      Reserve in 2005 where he was a four year member of the men’s basketball team.
      He began his career working for Lockheed Martin as a software engineer in
      the Washington, DC area.  During that time he served in a number of roles
      including software developer, security and database administrator, and
      technical proposal manager while working on contracts for the IRS and TSA.
      In 2010 he earned a MS in information Systems from Johns Hopkins University.
      In May of 2013 he joined Microsoft’s Productivity, Access, and Identity Experience
      (PAIX) group in Redmond, WA where he serves as a software design engineer.


      Prior to leaving the Washington, DC area Isaac served as the head coach of
      the DC Vipers youth men’s basketball program.  He also founded Out of Bounds,
      a non-profit organization, which focuses on educating high school student
      athletes about college athletic scholarship eligibility.  Isaac is an avid
      basketball player, a photo hobbyist, and is enthusiastic about web design 
      and mobile technology.   His passions include talking to young people about
      life and their careers, and using technology to solve the world’s problems.

    title: MapReduce and Google's Pregel Framework
    bio: >
      The talk starts with a brief introduction of the MapReduce system. The
      MapReduce system makes it easy to parallelize a particular form of
      computation across a large data set. It automates the process of
      splitting up and coordinating that computation and its data to run on
      thousands of machines at once. Although the implementation of
      MapReduce is complex, understanding MapReduce is actually not hard.


      Next, the Pregel project will be introduced. The objective of the
      Pregel project is to provide a unified framework for performing
      large-scale graph computations at Google that enables users to focus
      on the actual algorithm, leaving many details to the Pregel framework,
      such as distributed and multi-threaded execution, load-balancing,
      fault tolerance, data representation. This introduction explains the
      basics of defining, running, and testing a graph algorithm using
      Pregel, as well as how the system is designed.
