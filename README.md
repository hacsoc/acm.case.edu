EECS Cabal @ CWRU
======================================

The EECS "Cabal" is a collection of student organizations in the Department of
Electrical Engineering & Computer Science (EECS) at Case Western Reserve
University.

Traditionally, the student groups have worked closely together to plan events
and improve student life. This website unifies all EECS Cabal groups (namely
ACM, IEEE, and Hacker Society) under one umbrella.
